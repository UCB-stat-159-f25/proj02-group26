Yujian Zhou:


I used ai for sanity check when I found my BERTopic result is different from the given one

Prompt: it seems my topic_info is different from the sample, is that because the seed of bert model is different?

Answer:Yes — your BERTopic results will almost always look different, even if you follow the instructions exactly.
This is normal, and it is NOT because you made a mistake.
Here’s why. ERTopic includes multiple sources of randomness:

1️⃣ UMAP dimensionality reduction

UMAP is non-deterministic by default unless you explicitly set:

umap_model = UMAP(random_state=42)


If you don’t set a seed for UMAP, your cluster structure will differ every run.

2️⃣ HDBSCAN clustering

HDBSCAN can also introduce small randomness unless you set:

hdbscan_model = HDBSCAN()


and even then, it may vary slightly due to distance ties and core point selection.

3️⃣ Sentence-transformers embeddings

If you do not specify the embedding model and you let BERTopic auto-load one, it may pick a slightly different default version or use GPU/CPU differences.

4️⃣ The sample output you showed is from a pre-trained example

Unless you use:

the same model

same preprocessing

same library version

same seeds

same random states

you cannot expect identical topic words.

🧪 If you want reproducible BERTopic topics

You must set seeds for all components:

from bertopic import BERTopic
from umap import UMAP
from hdbscan import HDBSCAN

umap_model = UMAP(random_state=42)
hdbscan_model = HDBSCAN()

topic_model = BERTopic(
    min_topic_size=3,
    umap_model=umap_model,
    hdbscan_model=hdbscan_model
)

docs = sou["Text"].to_list()
topics, probs = topic_model.fit_transform(docs)


Also, if you want 100% reproducibility, fix the embedding model:

topic_model = BERTopic(
    min_topic_size=3,
    embedding_model="all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    umap_model=UMAP(random_state=42),
    hdbscan_model=HDBSCAN()
)


Now your results will stabilize across reruns.

I also used ai to help polish the figures, for example ask how to change color style of heatmap, how to add hide manually adjust x-ticks when having thousands of indexes.
