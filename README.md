This repository contains group 26's work for Project 2: Reproducibility in NLP.
The goal of this project is to build a modern, fully reproducible NLP workflow while exploring both classical and transformer-based text-analysis methods.

In this project, we implement the following:

Part 1 — Data Loading & Exploration: Import and clean text data and perform exploratory data analysis to conduct  basic summary statistics and initial linguistic inspection

Part 2: Simple Text Processing: Tokenization, lemmatization using spaCy, get common words in specific years, TF-IDF vectorization

Part 3: Advanced Text Processing: LDA and BERTopic modeling
